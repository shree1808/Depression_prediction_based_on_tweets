kf6eh7s,"I actually do all those things. If I start letting some of those practices slip I can spiral back into anxiety and depression.

It's taken years to get to this point. For anyone wanting to get here, start with the biggest and most impactful actions. Sleep, Exercise and Diet are the top 3. Pick one and slowly improve that one. When that one thing feels like it is stable (maybe after a few weeks of slow change) start working on the next one.

The rest listed are supports. They each add value. Slowly add what you feel you've been most impacted by. Keep an app that tracks my mood helps me see that changes over time on a month by month basis.  


Getting a therapist is a good way to start if starting any of this feels overwhelming. I had a few years of therapy along the way.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Here‚Äôs a tip: make one change at a time. Let‚Äôs use the comic for an example. Drink one litre (4 cups, or about 3 normal glasses) of water a day, and set that as your goal. Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

kf5r57t,"I‚Äôm almost 40, and in my experience, kids and teens have always been a little shy around adults.  Not all, of course, but many.  

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

I will agree there definitely is a good percentage of people with depression that need antidepressants as there is a irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain 

However because of my own personal experience and observations with people I know with depression I really believe a majority of it is avoidable and reversible to a very large degree

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle.

kf5r57t,"I‚Äôm almost 40, and in my experience, kids and teens have always been a little shy around adults.  Not all, of course, but many.  

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

As an adult in the workforce (desk job), I've had to ""relearn"" large portions my own job at least a million times in the past few years because we keep upgrading or changing platforms. Not to mention that there is one system for each type of task, and I do like 20 tasks. It's exhausting to stay on top of it all while remaining efficient when you finally master the new method and then are told to learn it again but differently. Idk how people do it.",Mental Health

kf6zylx,"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 19 and was told it was likely genetic due to my mother's past history with it 

I will agree there definitely is a good percentage of people with depression that need antidepressants as there is a irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain 

However because of my own personal experience and observations with people I know with depression I really believe a majority of it is avoidable and reversible to a very large degree

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

kf63z0b,"Fair. I guess I should qualify that it has to be something that ideally isn't harmful to you. Some harmful behaviors can keep your sanity in check even though they are bad for you. Self harm was a crutch I used at one time and honestly my psych didn't care, because it got me through suicidal moments. Better living with some cuts than dead. Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die. 

Smoking is an example of a bad health practice that is ok to do as a crutch while healing. The key is abuse and addiction. Abuse and addiction in almost any form are detrimental to mental states. They often go hand in hand sadly.",Mental Health

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Here‚Äôs a tip: make one change at a time. Let‚Äôs use the comic for an example. Drink one litre (4 cups, or about 3 normal glasses) of water a day, and set that as your goal. Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle.

kf5r57t,"I‚Äôm almost 40, and in my experience, kids and teens have always been a little shy around adults.  Not all, of course, but many.  

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

It's taken years to get to this point. For anyone wanting to get here, start with the biggest and most impactful actions. Sleep, Exercise and Diet are the top 3. Pick one and slowly improve that one. When that one thing feels like it is stable (maybe after a few weeks of slow change) start working on the next one.

The rest listed are supports. They each add value. Slowly add what you feel you've been most impacted by. Keep an app that tracks my mood helps me see that changes over time on a month by month basis.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Here‚Äôs a tip: make one change at a time. Let‚Äôs use the comic for an example. Drink one litre (4 cups, or about 3 normal glasses) of water a day, and set that as your goal. Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

I will agree there definitely is a good percentage of people with depression that need antidepressants as there is a irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain 

However because of my own personal experience and observations with people I know with depression I really believe a majority of it is avoidable and reversible to a very large degree

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

It's taken years to get to this point. For anyone wanting to get here, start with the biggest and most impactful actions. Sleep, Exercise and Diet are the top 3. Pick one and slowly improve that one. When that one thing feels like it is stable (maybe after a few weeks of slow change) start working on the next one.

The rest listed are supports. They each add value. Slowly add what you feel you've been most impacted by. Keep an app that tracks my mood helps me see that changes over time on a month by month basis.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Here‚Äôs a tip: make one change at a time. Let‚Äôs use the comic for an example. Drink one litre (4 cups, or about 3 normal glasses) of water a day, and set that as your goal. Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

I will agree there definitely is a good percentage of people with depression that need antidepressants as there is a irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain 

However because of my own personal experience and observations with people I know with depression I really believe a majority of it is avoidable and reversible to a very large degree

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.  A lot of jobs that would have allowed people to support a family without a degree don‚Äôt exist anymore, and inflation has been outpacing wages anyways.  In general, things have changed.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health

It's taken years to get to this point. For anyone wanting to get here, start with the biggest and most impactful actions. Sleep, Exercise and Diet are the top 3. Pick one and slowly improve that one. When that one thing feels like it is stable (maybe after a few weeks of slow change) start working on the next one.

The rest listed are supports. They each add value. Slowly add what you feel you've been most impacted by. Keep an app that tracks my mood helps me see that changes over time on a month by month basis.

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.

Here‚Äôs a tip: make one change at a time. Let‚Äôs use the comic for an example. Drink one litre (4 cups, or about 3 normal glasses) of water a day, and set that as your goal. Do that for a whole week. If you succeeded in this goal, then add one more, like meditating. Now for a week your two goals are water and meditation. Slowly add more and more, one at a time.

Making dramatic change in your life is extremely hard. The biggest mistake people make is going cold-turkey and doing a 180 from their existing lifestyle. All this will do is shock you and you‚Äôll be so uncomfortable from the myriad changes that not only will you give up, but the trauma of the attempt and shame from the failure will prevent you from trying again in the future.

To the extent that this new generation constantly seems to be anxious and overwhelmed, I have to wonder if maybe it‚Äôs because they grew up in the age of social media.  They‚Äôre constantly connected 24/7 to everyone in their peer groups and beyond.  They probably never get a break from all those social pressures since they‚Äôre always connected and bombarded with them.  

I also think new generations are taught to be more open with how they feel.  There‚Äôs also been an effort to remove some of the stigma around mental health issues.  Put these two together, and maybe what this says is that they‚Äôre not so different from us, but simply allowed to express how they feel without being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or be called a wimp or whatever by their peers (or worse - the adults that are supposed to be looking out for them).

For teenagers who are being confronted with the prospect of deciding their path in life, this has always been incredibly stressful, but I wonder if it‚Äôs worse now.  There‚Äôs still an enormous amount of pressure to go to college, for instance, to ‚Äúget a good job‚Äù when so many employers no longer are impressed by a degree and college is insanely expensive compared to what it used to be.

This is a point that I've been arguing for quite some time. As an adult in the workforce (desk job), I've had to ""relearn"" large portions my own job at least a million times in the past few years because we keep upgrading or changing platforms. Not to mention that there is one system for each type of task, and I do like 20 tasks. It's exhausting to stay on top of it all while remaining efficient when you finally master the new method and then are told to learn it again but differently. Idk how people do it.",Mental Health
kf616zg,"That makes sense, and I think there's always been socially strong/weak people. For some kids being connected to an insanely large world isn't a problem.

kf6zylx,"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 19 and was told it was likely genetic due to my mother's past history with it 

I will agree there definitely is a good percentage of people with depression that need antidepressants as there is a irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain 

However because of my own personal experience and observations with people I know with depression I really believe a majority of it is avoidable and reversible to a very large degree

Alot of people (including myself) likely have imbalances in brain chemistry as a result of lifestyle consuming processed food, drugs, alcohol, pornography, social media, excessive caffine use all massively stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and when overused or used together in ""moderation"" will seriously change your brain chemistry over time 

To say stopping all these things completely when depressed is hard is an understatement however if people are able to while incorporating healthy ways to stimulate dopamine Mediation, reading, going outdoors, being social, cold exposure, working out on a consistent basis over years the chemistry of their brain will change massively and will either help enormously or in some instances ""fix"" their depression (therapy is also borderline essential)",Mental Health
kf86kme,Also many people ***need*** to do things that are bad for their physical and mental health like working jobs just so that they have enough money to survive.,Mental Health
kf63z0b,"Fair. I guess I should qualify that it has to be something that ideally isn't harmful to you. Some harmful behaviors can keep your sanity in check even though they are bad for you. Self harm was a crutch I used at one time and honestly my psych didn't care, because it got me through suicidal moments. Better living with some cuts than dead. Still not good, and we eventually worked on getting rid of that habit, but it came after dealing with my wish to die. 

Smoking is an example of a bad health practice that is ok to do as a crutch while healing. The key is abuse and addiction. Abuse and addiction in almost any form are detrimental to mental states. They often go hand in hand sadly.",Mental Health

Right? Right? 

Other depressed people telling a person with depression and other disorders that he doesn‚Äôt know about depression just because the words I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt make you feel good is wild. 

Sorry. I probably understand it better than you and I actually do something to get better. 

Like I said before, most of you choose to stay sad by not choosing to do something different. That‚Äôs your lives, I don‚Äôt care.

kf5wt91,"Agreed. So much of this stuff is 'what works for you'. Meditation doesn't work for me, I just find it a waste of time... but, writing each day in a log book does bring me mental clarity, so I do that. If typing works for others, great.

It's taken years to get to this point. For anyone wanting to get here, start with the biggest and most impactful actions. Sleep, Exercise and Diet are the top 3. Pick one and slowly improve that one. When that one thing feels like it is stable (maybe after a few weeks of slow change) start working on the next one.

The rest listed are supports. They each add value. Slowly add what you feel you've been most impacted by. Keep an app that tracks my mood helps me see that changes over time on a month by month basis.  


Getting a therapist is a good way to start if starting any of this feels overwhelming. I had a few years of therapy along the way.

I wasn't really thrilled at the idea but looking back I can't deny that it played a big part in improving my mental health. I still hate going to the gym, but I like being at the gym (especially since I'm doing it with a good friend), and feel great when I get back *from* the gym.",Mental Health

Once you can do the easiest one and you're pretty comfortable with it, move on to the second easiest.

The key to making progress is tiny, achievable goals; realize that failure (more accurately, slip-ups or setbacks) means you're going in the right direction; and aim for progress, not perfection.

Also:  Choose your battles.  Porn, for example, is simply erotic art.  As long as it's by consenting adults who aren't being manipulated into it, watching porn in moderation is a healthy pastime, just like partaking of any other art form.  Socializing might cause a lot of stress in your life.
